The repository contains the input data for modeling and simulations, outputs from analyses and associated scripts to reproduce our data. The the MD trajectories have been deposited in OSF due to space limitation. They can be downloaded from here:

A more detailed README file is in each subfolder

- lipidomics_data includes the lipidomics data analyzed in the paper 
for the case studies on ER and atg9a+ compartments


- modeller_data includes the data related to the modeling of p23 and p24 transmembrane regions 

- study_cases include two folders with the scripts and results of analyses (which require modeller_data or the
file included in OSF):
modeller_analysis  
simulations_analysis
