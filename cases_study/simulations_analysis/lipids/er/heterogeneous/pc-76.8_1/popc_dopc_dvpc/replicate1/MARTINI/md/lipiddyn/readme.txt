#to run the LipidDyn analysis the input files are:
#-trajectory file in xtc format with fixed pbc issues 
#-reference gro file, including same atoms as the xtc file
#-yaml configuration file (coarse_grained.yml)  provided in the working directory

-Run the bash script lipiddyn_fatslim.sh to reproduce the analysis of APL and Thickness calculation on the case of study of heterogeneous membrane from lipidomics data
#cd density_last_us
-Run the bash script lipiddyn_dmaps.sh to reproduce the analysis of 2Density map on the last us of the simulation
#cd ..


N.B. The analysis included here are the ones revised and tested so far 10th December 2021

The input gro and xtc files are retrieved from ../../../../../../../../../../../../simulations/p23_p24/membrane_bound/p23_186-206/model_probuilder/heterogeneous/pc-50_sm-20_chol-30/popc_dpsm_chol/replicate1/MARTINI/md/prot_memb
